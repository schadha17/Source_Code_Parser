# Source_Code_Parser

Author: Siddharth Chadha 

Application: 

This source code parser can be used to analyse important information such as (number of TODO's, number of single line comments,
number of block comments and much more) before merged the source code into build pipeline.

One important use case is not merging the code until all TODO's are removed. Sometimes, engineers write TODO's to take care of trivial
tasks later but forget to solve those. This source code parser can come handy in that siutation. 

Feel free to discuss more use cases and more innovative ideas to use this parser to solve more problems.
